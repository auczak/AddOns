An addon based on Quick DKP, by Lemon Jello.  (Airiena of Dragonmaw)
From version 1.6 coded by Riccardo Belloli.  (Spaccakuli of Crushridge)
Quick DKP's Logo is a copyright of Rozak of Dragonmaw
Includes Chronos, a timing library by AlexanderYoshi, and Thott

This mod is released under the GNU GPL License V3 (see license.txt)

I've rewrote most of the functions of the original Quick DKP mod and
added alot of features but the base mod, expecially the GUI, is by Airiena. 
The basic idea of a DKP mod that stores the data in the officer notes is Gareth's of Dragonmaw
